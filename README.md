# CS420_Final
This project dockerizes a python web application (in this case, an instance of the game "snake") and hosts it on the web via Microsoft AWS. 

User scores are stored locally and are accessible via a REST API. 

UPDATE the solution is currently constrained by lack of docker support for some python dependencies which appear in the codebase for the game service.
Because the solution does not build, it does not deploy to Azure. Instead, the sample code has taken it's place.
